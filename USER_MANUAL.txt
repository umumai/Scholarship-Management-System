Scholarship Management System - User Manual

1) Start the Servers (Local)
Backend (API):
- Open a terminal in the project root folder.
- Run:
  cd backend
  ../.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Frontend (Web App):
- Open a second terminal in the project root folder.
- Run:
  npm install
  npm run dev
- Vite will print a URL like http://localhost:3001. Open that in your browser.

Important:
- http://localhost:8000 is the backend API and is NOT the site UI.
